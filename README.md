3. Uncheck the checkmark next to the text `Copy the staging branch only` and press the `Create fork` button

![Uncheck copy staging branch only and press create fork button step](./static/images/guide/uncheck-copy-branch-create-fork-step-governance-docs.png)

You have now successfully created a fork of the original filecoin-docs repository.

#### Moving into the `feat/governance-section` branch

1. On the following screen, press the `branches` tab

![Branches step](./static/images/guide/branches-step-governance-docs.png)

2. Search for `governance` and then follow the link `feat/governance-section`

![Search 2 step](./static/images/guide/search-2-step-governance-docs.png)

#### Before adding content

1. Ensure that you're on the  `feat/governance-section` branch

![Ensure Governance branch step](./static/images/guide/ensure-governance-branch-step.png)

Note, if you aren't seeing the `/governance` directory under `/basics`, you might be on the wrong branch

![Check wrong branch step](./static/images/guide/check-wrong-branch-step.png)

2. Ensure your fork is in sync with the original docs before adding new content. Press the `Sync fork` button. That way, you'll sync any changes that others have made with your fork/copy.

![Sync fork step](./static/images/guide/sync-fork-step.png)

#### Adding content

1. Move into the `/content/en` directory

![Content directory step](./static/images/guide/content-directory-step-governance-docs.png)

2. Move into the `/basics` directory, and following, move into the `/governance` directory

![Move into basics > governance directory step](./static/images/guide/move-into-basics-governance-directory.png)

3. Move into the directory where you wish to add content, for example, `/fip-process`, and open the `index.md` file

![Open directory and index.md file](./static/images/guide/open-section-index-file-step.png)

4. Press the pencil button to edit the file

![Edit file step](./static/images/guide/edit-file-step.png)

5. To add a file, press the `Add file` button inside a directory

![Add file step](./static/images/guide/add-file-step.png)

#### Saving content

1. Once done with editing, press the `Commit changes...` button or press `Cmd + s`

![Commit changes step](./static/images/guide/commit-changes-step.png)

2. Commit changes with a helpful message [^2]

![Commit changes step](./static/images/guide/commit-message-step.png)

#### Opening a pull request

1. Move to `Pull Requests`

![Move to pull requests step](./static/images/guide/move-to-pull-requests-step.png)

2. Press `Compare & pull request` [^3]

![Press compare & pull request step](./static/images/guide/press-compare-pull-request-step.png)

3. Ensure the pull request is being made against the `filecoin-project/filecoin-docs` repo, and against the `feat/governance-section`

![Ensure correct base repositories step](./static/images/guide/ensure-correct-base-repositories-step.png)

4. Check your changes and press `Create pull request`

![Press create pull request step](./static/images/guide/press-create-pull-request-step.png)

You have now successfully submitted your changes for review.

##### Note on opening pull requests

It's useful to have a pull request per page. For example, if you're writing about the FIP Process, create a pull request for that page. However, if you're making a bunch of edits or updates across a few different pages, then you can do that in one pull request.

<!-- TIPS -->
## Tips

1. Read the [filecoin.doc README](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs). The [Front-matter variables section](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-docs#front-matter-variables) might be especially useful.

2. Browse the directories of other documentation sections in the `/content/en` directory for ideas. It might be especially helpful to check the `raw` view of files by pressing the `raw` button inside a file.

![Press raw button step](./static/images/guide/raw-button-step.png)

3. Ask ChatGPT to convert any document or text as Markdown.

4. Ask ChatGPT to create individual Markdown bits, like, for example, a table.
<!-- /TIPS -->



[^1]: _A fork_ is just another term for _A copy_

[^2]: _Commit changes_ is just another way of saying _Save changes_

[^3]: A pull request sends your edits over to the maintainers of the original filecoin-docs for approval. Once approved, your changes will be merged (a.k.a _added_) to the original repository.
